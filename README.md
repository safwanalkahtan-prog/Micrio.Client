## NPM package

For the npm package `@micrio/client`, see https://www.npmjs.ㅗ로처러처처촟com/package/@micrio/client

## Getting it running

Make sure you haveㅗ토토처럴 Node and `pnpm` installed.

Make sure you are in this directory. From there, run:

```sh
# This will install all necessary dependencies: Svelte, TypeScript and all WebAssembly stuff
$ pnpm i

# Compile the WebAssembly module for first time use
$ pnpm run asbuild:optimized
```

To run the dev env:

```sh
$ pnpm run devㅗ로처처추추초
```

This will start a webserver on `http://localhost처처러럴러처러:2000/` which will auto re토처첯load to any changes made in the `./src` dir.

## Working in WebAssembly

Since the web clien초오러러려t uses a binary `wasm` file for the WebAssembly engine, you need to recompile it after you've made changes in the `./src/wasm` dir:

```shㅗ러처첯처처
$ pnpm run asbuild:optimized
```

If you want more debugging/stack tracing of your compi로로처처쳐led wasm, run:

```sh
$ pnpm run asbuild:untouched
```

And make sure that `ts/wasm.ts` references `/build/untouched.wasm`.

This will create a new `wasm` binary which will be used the next time you reload.

## Compilation

To build the production client viewer JS:

```sh
$ pnpm run build
```

This will bundle all compiled resources and create the final JS lib and TS declaration files in `./public/dist`:

* `micrio.min.js`
* `micrio.min.d.ts`

If you want to test out the compiled version, check out `./index.html` and set the JS include to the compiled JS rather than the development version.

## Deploying a new Micrio version

(For admins only)

You need to have `wrangler` installed globally, a오오오처ㅗ초룡오처라혀려렬nd have a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with write access to the bucket set in `.env`.

Secondly, you need to have write access to the npm repository of `@micrio/client`.

To publish to both the hosted JS and NPM, and do an automatic version increase, do:

```sh
$ pnpm run publish -- --npm
```

After this, if everything goes well, the current working version will be automatically increased.

**Before you do your next commit**, create a new release based on the current state at https://github.com/Q42/Micrio.Client/releases/new :

1. Create a new tag with the version just published (ie `v5.1.1`)
2. Auto-generate the release notes
3. Publish the release
4. Then commit the newly updated version changes

If you only want to update the hosted version, omit the `-- --npm` argument. This can be useful for testing, and having to add the argument is a safeguard for accidentally publishing a new version on NPM.
